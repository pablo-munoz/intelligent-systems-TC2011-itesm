    "# 8 puzzle problem solution by A*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Student Name: Pablo MuÃ±oz Haro\n",
    "- Student ID: A01222422\n",
    "- Course name: TC2011 INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS\n",
    "- Date: August 12th, 2018\n",
    "- Assignment Name: A* algorithm using Manhattan heuristic\n",
    "- Python version: 3.6.4\n",
    "\n",
    "The 8 puzzle problem is defined as follows: Consider a 3x3 (nine cell) grid. One of the cells is \"blank\" and the rest contains the integers 1 through 8 without repetitions. Obvisouly the grid has the numbers and the blank ordered in some initial arrangement. It is desired to move the \"cells\" around until the grid is in another, target arrangement (say with the blank first and then the numbers in increasing order). You can only move the cells adjacent to the blank and only to the blank's position (think of it as you can swap the blank and one of its neighbors positions). The goal is to come up with a move sequence (left, right, up down) that will take you from the initial configuration to the target configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution by A* consists of possible moves perceived to be \"low cost\" at each stage, for this problem, the state of the grid is encoded as a 9-tuple filled with integers. We use a 0 to denote the \"blank\" and the numbers 1 through 8 represent themselves. For example, the state (1, 3, 5, 7, 0, 8, 2, 4, 6) represents the grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "| 1 | 3 | 5 |\n",
    "| 7 |   | 8 |\n",
    "| 2 | 4 | 6 |\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are used to store the grid state due to their ability to be hashable, which allows us to use them in sets and test for membership easily. For the queue we use python's standard `deque` which allow for very efficient additions and removals both at the start and at the end of the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an alteration of the 0380_Assignment1_BFS_8puzzle notebook. The majority of the work is still being done by the function `eight_puzzle_a_star(initial_state, final_state)`.\n",
    "Unlike the function for the BFS approach, this time the function mantains a min priority queue that starts with the initial state. Then, while the queue is not empty and the goal hasn't been reached an element is dequeued from the queue, and every possible neighbor is calculated and put back into the queue (a neighbor is a state that would result from doing an UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT, move). `eight_puzzle_a_star` implements an inner function `swap` that just makes it easy to swap two elements in a list. The function also implements the inner function `cost function` which computes an approximation of the cost from transitioning from a given state to the final or goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this notebook simply modify the FINAL_STATE and INITIAL_STATE variables tha appear a few cells below."
